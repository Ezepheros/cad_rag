      "[13] The Respondent maintains that it is aware of the existence of a line of authorities that tend to confer on the Tribunal the jurisdiction necessary to decide on the merits of this dispute. It adds, however, that this line of authorities ought to be revisited in light of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration Board v.

      "[14] In Parry Sound, the Supreme Court of Canada had to rule on the application of human rights and other employment-related statutes within the ambit of a collective agreement.

      "[16] Despite the wording of the collective agreement, the Board found that the grievance was arbitrable on the ground that the substantive rights recognized by the Human Rights Code6 were imported into the collective agreement over which the grievance arbitrator had jurisdiction. It was this ruling that was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n",

      "[18] In its written argument, the Respondent essentially goes on at length about the Supreme Court's analysis of section 48 of the Labour Relations Act, 1995,7 notably paragraph 48(12)(j), and its similarities with paragraph 60(1)(a.1) of the Canada Labour Code.8 According to the Respondent, these provisions confer on the grievance arbitrator or the arbitration board, as the\n",
