REASONS FOR DECISION
[1] The Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) received a notice of appeal regarding a decision rendered by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in the claims for refugee protection filed by XXXXX and XXXXX.
[2] The claim filed by the person who is the subject of the appeal was referred to the RPD on May 1, 2013. According to the notice of appeal, they are appealing the RPD decision dated August 9, 2013, rejecting their claim for refugee protection. The written reasons for this decision were received on August 13, 2013.
[3] The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the appeal deals with an RPD decision that is not subject to appeal, pursuant to paragraph 110(2)(d) of the amended Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which reads as follows:
110. (2) No appeal may be made in respect of any of the following:
... (d) subject to the regulations, a decision of the Refugee Protection Division in respect of a claim for refugee protection if
o (i) the foreign national who makes the claim came directly or indirectly to Canada from a country that is, on the day on which their claim is made, designated by regulations made under subsection 102(1) and that is a party to an agreement referred to in paragraph 102(2)(d), and
(ii) the claim - by virtue of regulations made under paragraph 102(1)(c) - is not ineligible under paragraph 101(1)(e) to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division.
[4] On the day on which the appellants claimed refugee protection, the United States was a country designated by regulations and a party to an agreement referred to in paragraph 102(2)(d). According to the RAD's administrative records, the appellants in this case arrived directly from the United States, but their claim for refugee protection was eligible to be referred under the Regulations. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 110(2)(d) of the IRPA, the RPD decision may not be appealed.
[5] The appeal is dismissed.
