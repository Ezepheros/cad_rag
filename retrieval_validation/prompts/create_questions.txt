You are generating realistic user queries for a legal retrieval system (RAG).  
Your goal is to create queries that a user might ask *without* knowing which case  
document contains the answer.

The queries should reflect the legal issues, principles, fact patterns, and  
situations discussed in the provided court decision, but MUST NOT reveal or  
directly quote the document. They must be written from the perspective of a user  
who has not seen the case and is describing their own situation or asking about  
a general legal concept.

### IMPORTANT RULES FOR QUERIES
1. Produce {num_queries} queries.
2. Write queries from the view of a user who does *not* know this document exists.
3. Write queries from the view of a user who does not know what principle of law to apply.
3. Queries should be realistic and phrased as natural questions a person might type into a search bar or ask a lawyer/LLM.
4. DO NOT reference names, dates, laws or specific events from the document.
5. Queries must be *grounded in the legal principles* present in the document  
   (e.g., contract formation, negligence, procedural fairness), and must clearly  
   relate to topics that the document could answer.
6. Introduce variety. Include:
   - Hypothetical situations (“If I…”, “What happens when…?”)
   - Conceptual legal questions (“How does the court determine…?”)
   - Outcome-oriented questions (“Would this count as…?”)
   - Multi-step or scenario-based questions requiring reasoning.
7. The questions should be moderately complex, not trivial.
8. Do NOT answer the questions. Output only the queries.
9. Output a JSON list of strings.

### EXAMPLES OF VALID QUERY STYLES (structure only — DO NOT reuse content)
- “If a supplier and I exchanged emails agreeing on price and quantities but didn't sign anything, could that count as a binding contract?”
- “How do courts evaluate whether an employment agreement was formed when the terms weren’t fully finalized?”
- “In a negligence claim, what factors determine whether someone had a duty of care in an informal relationship?”
- “Would performing actions X and Y after a verbal agreement be enough to show mutual assent in contract formation?”
