Overview
[1] The appellant pled guilty to 24 charges arising out of four robberies and three break and enters that occurred between October 6, 2008, and March 2, 2009. The appellant received sentences totalling seven years and nine months’ imprisonment, having been given three months’ credit for his pre-sentence custody. He appeals conviction and sentence.
[2] The conviction appeal focuses on the multiple convictions arising out of three of the robberies to which the appellant pled guilty. In respect of each of those robberies, the appellant pled guilty to and was convicted of:
· robbery with a firearm;
· unlawful confinement of employees at the places robbed; and
· the use of a firearm in the commission of the unlawful confinement of the employees.
[3] The appellant submits that the Kienapple principle precludes convictions on all three charges arising out of the same delict: R. v. Kienapple, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. Counsel submits that the appellant should have been convicted of only the charge of robbery with a firearm and that the unlawful confinement and use of a firearm in the commission of an unlawful confinement charges should have been stayed. In his submissions, counsel directed most of his attention to the use of a firearm in the commission of an unlawful confinement charges. This emphasis is understandable in that those charges attracted a mandatory one-year minimum sentence that had to be made consecutive to the robbery sentences. In practical terms, staying the unlawful confinement charges would have no effect on the total sentence, but staying the use of a firearm in the commission of an unlawful confinement charges could reduce the total sentence by three years.
[4] The appellant also appeals his sentence. He argues that the combination of the requirement in s. 85(4) of the Criminal Code that any sentence imposed for the use of a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence be consecutive to any other punishment for offences arising out of the same event and consecutive to any other sentence being served at the time is unconstitutional when combined with the mandatory four-year minimum penalty for use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery. This submission assumes that the appellant’s conviction appeal has not succeeded and the court has affirmed his convictions on the charges of using a firearm in the commission of an unlawful confinement.
[5] I would allow the conviction appeal. In my view, the appellant was properly convicted of both the robbery with a firearm and the unlawful confinement charges relating to each robbery. I would hold, however, that the charges alleging the use of a firearm in the commission of the unlawful confinement should have been stayed given the convictions on the armed robbery charges. In my view, entering convictions on both offends the Kienapple principle.
[6] In light of my holding that the use of the firearm charges should be stayed, there is no need to address the appellant’s argument
